# MyMeteo – Weather CLI for Poland

**MyMeteo** is a **cross-platform command-line tool** (Bash for Linux/macOS, PowerShell for Windows) designed to provide **real-time weather information** for any city in Poland.

It allows users to:

- **Fetch geographic coordinates** for a city using the **Nominatim API**.
- **Retrieve current weather data** from the **IMGW-PIB API** for the nearest meteorological station.
- **Cache results locally** to reduce API requests and speed up repeated queries.
- **Use command-line arguments** like `--city`, `--help`, and `--debug/--verbose`.
- **Customize settings** via a configuration file (e.g., `~/.mymeteorc`).
- Enjoy **additional enhancements** like colored output and a clear, user-friendly display.

This tool is **ideal for weather enthusiasts, developers, and anyone needing quick weather info from the terminal**.
